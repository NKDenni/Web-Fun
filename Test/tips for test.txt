TIPS FOR WF TEST SUCCESS

PLEASE DO
- Use your notes, past assignments, and the Internet to help you
- Use the HTML validator (doesn't work on CSS btw, don't worry about that)
- Use a separate CSS file
- Use a wrapper div with a fixed height and width to contain everything
- Get all HTML elements on page, use proper tags (use <button> where you see a button, etc)
- Pay attention to how many times you use classes/ids (id names should only show up once, class names multiple times)
- Indent your HTML code, and write neat CSS
- Use a separate folder for your test (the folder only contains the relevant HTML/CSS/images for the test only)
- Hand something in within your time limit (I can't grade nothing)
- Understand that it does not have to be perfect to pass, go for "close enough"
- Keep a relaxed mind :) Plan out your time
- Watch all of this month's lecture videos + weekend session video if you haven't yet




PLEASE TRY TO DO
- Draw a box model -> Position your divs before you start adding content to them
- Recreate the page as best as possible (if something looks green, use the color green instead of trying to find the exact color at first)
- Inform me if you are colorblind
- Work on one piece of your file at once
- Use as few divs as possible
- Use as few classes/ids as possible
- Use chaining selectors (ul li, #about h4) where possible
- Use meaningful names in your ids/classes so that non-coders could understand them





PLEASE DON'T
- Use your other classmates to help you
- Not use the HTML validator (gee, I mention this a lot!)
- Have an img src be an absolute path specific to your computer (C://Users/LilBilly/Desktop... That is specific to just LilBilly's computer!)
- Make up your own HTML tags
- Put any CSS/width/height/<style> in your HTML file
- Have a single image be the only thing inside of a div
- Code for many hours straight - take a lunch break, walk, or bathroom break if you need to clear your mind
- <br> (Display + margin/padding instead)
- <hr>
- float: _______ (Display + margin/padding + vertical-align instead)
- position: _______ (99% of the time you don't need it)





MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND
- display property, flexbox concepts, when flex comes in handy and when it shouldn't be used
- margin/padding
- vertical-align
- why you would use a class or an id in a situation
